Hi there,

Here is my project written with node.js technology
This is my own blog. At the moment I'm not going to post something interesting there (maybe in the near future, if I become popular).
Now I'm working on it for studying, practicing and just for fun.

Packages used: express, ejs, body-parser, mongoose, method-override.
Database used: MongoDB

Authorization is coming soon

Thanks,
Andrii
